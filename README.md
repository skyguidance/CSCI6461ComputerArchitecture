#### Detail about "LOAD MEM" Button

LOAD MEM expects a CSV file which contains formatted MEM data. It should have 2 fields, which are 


<Memory Location(Binary String)>,<Data(Binary String)>.


Here is an example:


>000000000001,0000011100011111<br>000000000010,0000011100011111<br>000000000011,0000011100011111<br>000000000100,0000011100011111
